The [rummage](/rummage/) project consists of self-contained [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) utilities that are too small and general to warrant their own package and/or artifact, but are too large, nuanced or handy to have around to be re-implemented over and over again.

This initial release includes:

 - rummage.Timer: An interface for scheduling tasks to run one or more times at some point in the future.
