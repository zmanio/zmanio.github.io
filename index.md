## [rummage](/rummage/) - <small>that one thing you always have to look for</small>

The [rummage](/rummage/) project consists of self-contained [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) utilities that are too small and general to warrant their own package and/or artifact, but are too large, nuanced or handy to have around to be re-implemented over and over again.

## [sbt-ghreadme](/sbt-ghreadme/) - <small>never repeat yourself or your documentation</small>

A SBT plugin that extends sbt-site by converting github-style README files into Jekyll documents included in the site.
